# Expense-Manager
My first application in Kotlin

Disclaimer. I am developing this application to get practical skills in working with Android in the Kotlin programming language. I'm sure there will be a lot of shit code and bugs in this application, but I don't want to bother with it.

As planned in the application should keep track of expenses.

In the future, I may rewrite this message, but not now.
